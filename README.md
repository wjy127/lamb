# QUIP

A new language to use [libuv](https://github.com/joyent/libuv) for lower resource usage.

This project is under being developing by [@yorkie](https://github.com/yorkie).


### What I Am Expected

* More lighter and less memory

* Based on [libuv](https://github.com/joyent/libuv)

* Similar syntax to Javascript

* It's a scripting language, but not need to be a dynamic language

* Pure C Implementation.


### Undetermined

* Dynamic Language, maybe or like GO-Lang.
